# stepfunctions-sdk-autocomplete 

Vscode extension that provides autocomplete for AWS StepFunctions SDK integrations. Only works with YAML ASL.

## Limitations
* The autocomplete is based on the AWS SDK schema for NodeJS and may differ from the StepFunctions syntax, but in most cases it will be correct or close enough.
* Only works for YAML ASL
* Early version - there may be some bugs
